Credit Cards Replace Small Business Loans 
Business Week (08/20/08) Tozzi, John

Small businesses (SMBs) are increasingly turning to credit cards as an alternative to business loans for financing expansion plans and other needs. Particularly as banks tighten their credit standards, experts say that credit card debt can offer a much needed source of funding. The National Small Business Association (NSBA) says the percentage of companies that use credit cards has climbed from 16 percent in 1993 to 44 percent today. Meanwhile, the percentage of small businesses using bank loans fell from 45 percent to 28 percent over that same time. Federal Reserve Bank surveys also show that SMBs are relying on credit cards as an alternative to small business lending. The Fed says 48 percent of companies used business credit cards in 2003, up from 34 percent in 1998. Meanwhile, various surveys show that between 20 percent and 30 percent of all SMBs carry a balance on their credit cards instead of paying off their balances in full each month. Not surprisingly, credit card companies are increasingly targeting SMBs, according to the Mercator Advisory Group, which reports that 12 percent of the 6 billion credit card offers mailed last year were sent to SMBs. &quot;As issuers have discovered the small business segment, they have become fairly aggressive about getting small business cards into the hands of some very early-stage businesses,&quot; says Mercator analyst Ken Paterson. Visa calculates that total small business spending in the United States reached $4.7 trillion last year, while Mercator estimates that the volume charged on small business payment cards, including debit, is only $283 billion. Although credit card debt interest rates can be high, for many SMBs it can provide crucial funding.

Positioning Your Company for Debt Financing 
Smart Business Ideas (07/08) Vol. 4, No. 7, P. 26; Honig, Gary

Once, going to the bank and applying for a loan was the only way of obtaining outside capital for a small business, but today many of the guidelines for running a company have been rewritten. Building your company incrementally is still key, and following a pre-prepared business plan, watching expenses, and increasing sales will help your company grow. In certain situations, however, borrowing is still the best solution for increasing growth or starting a company, and knowing what commercial finance companies look for will make your business a more attractive prospect for financing. First, finance companies look for incoming revenue to be spread evenly over a number of customers, so avoid making one or two large sales and then forgetting to find more customers. Second, be sure that your customers and business partners are as creditworthy as you want your company to be. Finance companies respect business owners that have a thorough credit-checking process and a variety of stable, creditworthy customers. Having a qualified bookkeeper on staff also can help as being able to produce an instant fiscal picture of your company will highlight the professionalism and sophistication of your business and show finance companies that you keep a close eye on your books. Pay all your taxes and be upfront about any past bankruptcies, either professional or personal, as it will enhance the finance companies&apos; ability to overlook past difficulties. Finally, be professional by answering calls and messages quickly, be prepared with information, and show up for meetings on time.

Location Incentives: Valuable Tax Breaks for Businesses 
Tax Hotline (08/08) Vol. 28, No. 8, P. 5; Plostock, Mark A.

The federal government offers tax breaks for companies to establish operations in economically distressed areas, and state and local governments also provide incentives to draw businesses to their communities. Governments offer a variety of tax breaks, collectively called location tax incentives, which can include abatements, credits deduction, and exemptions. Abatements are the reduction of real estate tax for a limited time. Credits are dollar-for-dollar savings off federal and/or state and local taxes for rehabilitating real estate and creating jobs. Deductions are subtractions from income subject to tax for investments in equipment within designated areas. Exemptions are income items that are not subject to tax. Federal tax breaks include employment credits of 20 percent of wages up to $15,000, enhanced Section 179 deductions for equipment purchases and an additional $35,000 limit on annual purchases, and special capital gains rules for sales of assets located within qualified areas. There are three types of federal qualified zones&amp;#151;empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and renewal communities. Qualified zones can be in both urban and rural locations, and descriptions are available from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. However, not every tax break is available for each designated area. For example, the enhanced Section 179 deduction for equipment purchases applies to empowerment zones and renewal communities but not to enterprise communities, and a full exclusion for capital gains from the sale of certain assets held more than five years applies only to renewal communities.

Collecting Debts Can Save Your Business 
U.S. News &amp; World Report (07/28/08) Vol. 145, No. 2, P. 113; Bandyk, Matthew

Many small businesses may feel obligated, or even willing to extend credit to their customers, but during difficult economic times collecting on these debts can be extremely difficult just when your business needs the money the most. Failing to collect on money owed can be a life-or-death issue for small businesses, and learning to collect on accounts receivable quickly and efficiently can be the difference between success and failure, experts say. At first, Brian Kendrick of KTM Auto in Plymouth, N.H., was more than willing to give people leniency on paying for repairs made to their cars. &quot;It was very much done on a handshake and a promise,&quot; Kendrick says. However, once delinquent payments became a problem, Kendrick decided to formalize the process. &quot;Now, we get all the information from the customer, and we agree to terms,&quot; he says. Many small business owners do not do the basic homework on their customers, says Michelle Dunn, author of the &quot;Ultimate Credit and Collections Handbook.&quot; Dunn recommends making all customers fill out a credit application, that is updated yearly, to track financial situations. Small business owners also have problems in failing to follow up on invoices. If a payment is needed, give the customer a call and use a friendly but firm tone to collect. A phone call often gets faster results than an email or letter because it is harder to ignore. &quot;It&apos;s harder to deal with owing money when the person is standing right there,&quot; Dunn says. However, it is important to be willing to negotiate and work with someone to get your payments. Ask for less up front, and ask questions about their jobs and what they are paid to find a way for customers to pay you.

The Basics of a Small Business Marketing Plan 
SmartBiz.com (07/11/08) Smith, Charen

A strong small business marketing plan contains a core message, a good, recognizable logo and brand, a Web site, business signatures such as business cards and fliers, and public exposure. First, determine a core message that will influence all aspects of your marketing campaign. The message can be about a new product or service, a redesign of the business or older products, or better customer service. Part of knowing your core message is knowing your audience. Who they are, where they live, how much they make, and how willing they are to buy your product are factors that must be considered. Explain to them why they need your product and structure your message so that it serves their needs. Next, create a strong, memorable logo and brand. The logo represents your business and its personality in a glance so when people see it they know what your are and will remember your business. The brand represents your business as a whole, including your logo, advertising campaign, and product. All businesses need a Web site, if only to provide Internet users with some basic information about the business, its location, operating hours, and a few product details. Explain who you are as a business, what your business does, and how your business can help your customers. Add more functionality to your Web site as your business grows. Print out business cards that include your Web site address to increase Web traffic and give your business a level of respectability. Hand out business cards to everyone you know and to potential business partners or clients. Finally, gain some exposure. Contact local media, as many newspapers and local magazines like to run stories about new businesses. Advertise in local media and post flyers in the community.

Win With Customer Ideas 
Investor&apos;s Business Daily (07/14/08) P. A3

Good customer service combines several key factors, says Joseph Michelli, author of &quot;The New Gold Standard.&quot; First and foremost is to ask questions of yourself. Michelli says to ask yourself whether you listen to customers in a way that allows you to innovate and increase customers&apos; perceived value, and to note what changes exist between the customer you served five years ago and the customer you serve now. He recommends finding a balance that combines current trends with past success. Consider everyone a customer, including your staff. By filling the needs of your staff and keeping them happy you ensure that they will work harder to keep customers happy. Give customer service teams the authority to solve problems instead of forcing them to simply serve as a relay between customers and another branch. Empowering employees expedites problem solving, making both the customer and the company feel better about the experience. The best customer service teams understand the underlying feelings and unspoken concerns in addition to listening to the initial complaint. Customer service professionals must also be knowledgeable on all aspects of the business and constantly be teaching themselves about new trends to create an experience that will bring customers back.

How to Create a Successful Web Site for Nothing (or Almost Nothing) 
Wall Street Journal (08/11/08) P. R1; Vara, Vauhini

A 2007 Jupiter Research LLC survey indicates that only just over a third of companies with fewer than 100 employees have Web sites, but experts note that even small business owners with a little time and money easily can obtain a Web presence. They need only begin by purchasing a domain name from Go Daddy Group Inc., Tucows Inc., or Register.com Inc. for as little as $10. While many small businesses spend $1,000 or more per year on Web hosting, firms can have their sites hosted for free through Microsoft Corp.&apos;s Office Live Small Business, Weebly Inc., or SynthaSite Inc., among others. After completing these tasks, small business owners can start building their sites, taking advantage of the tools offered by free hosting services. The number and type of Web pages will depend on the nature of the business; but all companies should have a home page to welcome visitors, an &quot;About&quot; page to spell out the firm&apos;s mission, a &quot;Contact&quot; page to ensure that prospective clients can reach them, and a &quot;Store&quot; page if they sell merchandise. If they deal with sales, firm owners should open eBay or PayPal accounts to facilitate transactions; and they should consider Google&apos;s AdSense service that places ads on the site and ensures they receive a small payment whenever an ad is clicked; however, they should keep in mind that some visitors are turned off by ads. Finally, they should use keywords that describe the business throughout the site and in page titles to boost the site&apos;s placement in search engine results and take advantage of such programs as Google Webmaster Tools to track site traffic.

How to Assemble an Employee Handbook 
Inc. Guidebook (08/08) Vol. 1, No. 5, P. 1

Many entrepreneurs find themselves too busy running their company to think about how to run it, only creating company policies when situations arise. However, creating policies in advance provides a measure of legal protection in the event that an employee sues for wrongful termination, harassment, or illegal discrimination. While not lawsuit-proof, a handbook establishes policies for the court and proves when the policy was put in place. Furthermore, establishing employment policies with a progressive, employee-friendly attitude can be a powerful tool for recruiting and sustaining morale. To create an employee handbook, first look at the big picture. Employee handbooks pit consistency against flexibility. Emphasizing at the beginning of the handbook that the handbook merely establishes general guidelines provides flexibility while establishing best practices. Be sure to address the legal issues. Harassment and discrimination guidelines must affirm that the company is an equal opportunity employer, that the company will not tolerate harassment or illegal discrimination, and outline the steps an employee should take to report violations. Identify as generally as possible the days and hours of the workweek, as well as rules for breaks and meals, as well as guidelines for determining which employees are salaried and which are hourly. Companies that work in potentially dangerous environments should detail a safety policy that meets state and federal regulations. Explain employee benefits. Companies must allow for jury duty and workers&apos; comp leave, and may states demand other leave options, such as for military service. Also outline any voluntary benefits, including insurance and retirement benefits, and family and bereavement leave. Require employees to acknowledge with a signed document that they have received and read the handbook, and that they will seek clarification on any unclear issue.

Use Collaboration as a Tool to Grow Your Small Business 
Michigan Live (08/21/08) Deaumud, Jennifer

The sharing of business information and ideas among partners, suppliers, and customers is a reasonable and intelligent approach toward building a successful small business (SMB), but few SMBs use collaborative business strategies to create opportunities, drive sales, and decrease expenses, writes Michigan Small Business &amp; Technology Development Center&apos;s Jennifer Deaumud. Collaborating can be beneficial to SMBs in marketing, advertising, distribution, personnel, cost sharing, accounting, and many other areas. Some business owners try to form collaborative-business strategies but are unsuccessful, while others believe that they do not have time to engage in a collaborative effort. To make a collaborative effort successful, small business owners must be able to articulate the mission, vision, and objective of their company. They also must create a business plan to break down the tasks of running the business into goals to help identify challenges, which will make it easier to identify areas for potential collaboration. After identifying specific areas, focus on communications by attending networking events to seek matches and collaborative opportunities and participate in brainstorming sessions to identify potential collaborators and establish objectives. After finding a potential collaborator, negotiate a potential relationship and define roles and expectations, establish metrics, and implement the new relationship. Collaboration does come with some challenges, including time and money, but new technologies have made collaboration more efficient and easily accessible to small business owners. Many SMBs collaborate through Webinars, wikis, and Internet-based counseling to support their work partners.

Steps to Achieve Growth 
Investor&apos;s Business Daily (08/13/08) P. A3

Growth within a small business creates new opportunities and excites and motivates workers, but knowing where growth comes from and when is the right time to expand a small business can be difficult. McKinsey analyzed 400 firms and found that boosting market share rarely drives growth, and that the key is actually which market segments you choose to compete in, even during slow periods. &quot;Downturns present great opportunities,&quot; says McKinsey&apos;s Patrick Viguerie. &quot;Everyone knows that, but no one acts on it.&quot; Viguerie and University of Pennsylvania Wharton School professor David Wessels provide some advice on growing your business. First, compare yourself to your rivals. Viguerie says most managers know why their company is profitable, but few understand those reasons relative to their peers. Examine two-year changes in revenue, profits, and cash flow. Be realistic about growth expectations. For example, when entering a mature market segment, do not expect rapid growth. Sometimes growth comes at a slower, but steady pace. Update the business and keep a balanced portfolio that maintains the core of the business while exploring growth opportunities. Use mergers and acquisitions to fill business positions and to acquire new technologies, but be sure to match purchases with judicious and timely divestments. Allocate resources responsibly by giving them to strong leaders and managers, instead of just pumping money into a division. Identify areas with growth potential and allocate capital and attention to those areas. Invest in how those areas are expect to perform in the future instead of how they are performing today.

Travel Slump Has an Upside: Deals on Hotels 
Wall Street Journal (08/28/08) P. D1; Jackson, Candace

Although U.S. hotel room rates are predicted to rise by approximately 2 percent this year, resort properties are actually offering lower rates than 2007. This is attributed to the rising cost of fuel and airline cutbacks, which have reduced demand for once-popular resort destinations, including Florida and Hawaii. Many cities and resort towns have also recently built new hotels, offering additional supply at a time when demand has fallen drastically. In order to attract visitors, many hotels are cutting rates and offering incentives, such as a free night or free meals, while others have chosen to not implement their annual rate increases. Caribbean resort chain Sandals is even offering travelers an airline credit of up to $550 per person for choosing to stay at one of its hotels. Online travel agency Travelocity will soon launch as &quot;Race to Savings&quot; promotion that will offer substantial discounts on rates at popular resorts in Florida and Mexico through January 2009. Though resorts are typically the first to react to reduced demand, many business hotels are also feeling the impact of high travel costs. About 30 percent of corporations reported that they have attempted to renegotiate their corporate rates, which are historically set a year in advance.

All the Right Moves: GPS Devices Let You Go Anywhere 
Open Air (08/08) P. 13

GPS navigational units were the most popular electronics item last holiday season. Americans purchased over $100 million in GPS devices during the three days after last Thanksgiving. One reason for their rise in popularity is a significant reduction in price that made the units more affordable. People are also becoming more aware of how useful the technology can be. For this article four GPS devices were tested for functionality and capabilities. The Lowrance XOG did not perform as well as higher-priced units, but at almost $200 less, it is a solid investment for a first-time buyer. More expensive units have more advanced interfaces and offer more options, including the ability to record your own voice for giving directions and the ability to see nearby points of interest on the route. At $499, the Magellan Maestro was the most expensive GPS device tested, and although it offered good navigation, its user interface was poor. The Garmin Nuvi 260W was the highest-rated GPS device tested. Reviewers liked its easy set up and graphical three-dimensional interface.
