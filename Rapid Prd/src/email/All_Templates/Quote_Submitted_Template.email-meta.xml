    <textOnly>We spoke previously regarding working out either a cash advance or loan for your business.  Since Spring and Summer are fast approaching, I wanted to reach out to you in case you have plans to expand your business before the upcoming busy seasons.  Many clients have been calling to increase marketing, complete upgrades, etc.

If you would like me to put together some cash advance or loan options, simply shoot me a call or email and I will get back to you with all of the details.   I can be reached at 240-514-3184 or at 1-877-467-2743 ext. 1320.

Thank you and have a great day.


Best wishes,
