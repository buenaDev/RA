    <textOnly>Since Spring and Summer are fast approaching, I wanted to reach out to you in case you have plans to expand your business before the upcoming busy seasons.  Many clients have been calling to increase marketing, complete upgrades, etc.  You have paid your loan or advance completely and are most likely eligible for additional funding at a discount.

Renewals are much simpler and faster than the original account.  Most of the time, the only paperwork required is the agreement because we have all of your previous information on file.  Also, they generally reward performance and loyalty on the renewal by either allotting more available funds, lowering the overall cost, or extending the estimated payback times.

If you would like me to put together some renewal options, simply shoot me a call or email and I will get back to you with all of the details. I can be reached at 240-514-3184 or at 1-877-467-2743 ext. 1320.


Thank you and have a great day.

Best wishes,
