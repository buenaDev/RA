		<a name="372988"></a><b>Six Strategies for Making Smart Hiring Decisions</b><br />
		<i>Information, Inc. (08/08) Corbin, Kenneth</i> <br />
		<br />
		Business leaders from all industries acknowledge that their staff is 
		their most valuable asset. Yet the way that many small businesses make 
		their hiring decisions indicates that they either don&#39;t share or ignore 
		this belief. The fact is that your staff is critical to your company’s 
		success, which means that you must have a plan in place for the 
		processes of recruiting, interviewing, and selecting your staff, just as 
		you have strategies for how you handle vendors, inventory, lenders or 
		investors, and customers. Here are six tips to help you make better 
		hiring decisions to ensure that your organization is filled with the 
		very best people from top to bottom. First, arrive at a definition of 
		your ideal candidate. It is impossible to recruit the best person for 
		the job if you don&#39;t have a clear idea of what that person would be 
		like. Next, never stop interviewing. Just as you should cast a wide net 
		when evaluating potential sources of qualified applicants, you should 
		never let yourself lapse into the ‘we&#39;re not hiring right now’ mode. 
		When interviewing a potential candidate, be sure to probe the 
		applicant’s character in the interview. Textbook interview questions 
		yield textbook interview answers. Try to come up with questions that the 
		applicant has not rehearsed through his job hunter’s guides. Fourth, 
		hire the person, not the resume. Remember that anyone can be trained on 
		the technical aspects of a job, but not everyone has the character and 
		personality to complement your team. Fifth, don&#39;t keep your best 
		prospects waiting. The odds are that they will be interviewing at 
		multiple companies, and they are not likely to wait around for your 
		company to get its act together. Finally, accept the fact that you must 
		hire people who will do their jobs better than you can. Successful 
		business leaders across the board agree that it is a vital part of 
		making smart hiring decisions. Your goal is to have the best possible 
		staff in place to advance your business, and once that staff is in 
		place, then your business is poised to rise to new heights in its own, 
		unique fashion.<br />

		<a name="373074"></a><b>Strategies for Reining in Energy Costs</b><br />
		<i>Wall Street Journal (07/05/08) Spors, Kelley K.</i> <br />
		<br />
		As energy prices continue to rise, small businesses are scrambling to 
		find ways to lower costs. While it may be tempting to try a patchwork 
		approach to saving energy, making slight alterations to a variety of 
		areas, it is more practical to concentrate on the biggest energy 
		consumers to save the most money with the least effort. For example, 
		restaurants can focus on installing highly-efficient refrigeration 
		systems and lighting, as those tend to be the biggest energy costs, says 
		consultant Virginia Lacy. Other strategies include energy-efficient 
		water heaters, switching to high gas mileage vehicles for deliveries, 
		and giving drivers access to GPS systems or mapping sites such as 
		MapQuest so they can find the most efficient route to a destination and 
		not have to drive around to find a location. Once the large energy 
		consumers are taken care of, focus on small changes in behavior that 
		could lead to big savings. For example, turn off equipment and lights 
		when not in use and make sure buildings are properly insulated. 
		Energy-efficient light bulbs can be a significant investment initially, 
		but they can pay for themselves in three years or less. A building 
		recommissioning, essentially a professional building tune-up, can help a 
		business save up to 10 percent on energy costs by checking for leaks in 
		heating and air-conditioning systems, among other strategies, Lacy says. 
		An energy audit can also help save money by helping businesses determine 
		which energy-strategy project will garner the fastest returns. Energy 
		auditors thoroughly analyze a business&#39; energy usage by examining energy 
		bills and inspecting equipment and the building. Many local utility 
		companies offer free energy audits to small businesses. The power 
		company can also help businesses find utility rate plans that best fit 
		their usage patterns.<br />

		<a name="370463"></a><b>Bad Breakup: A Checklist for Employee 
		Termination</b><br />
		<i>Washington SmartCEO (07/08) Vol. 4, No. 7, P. 51; Baskin, Maurice</i>
		<br />
		<br />
		Recent surveys suggest that nearly half of all employment terminations 
		result in some type of administrative complaint or litigation, and while 
		there is no way to completely avoid such disputes, small businesses can 
		protect themselves by better preparing for employee separations and 
		post-termination actions. Before terminating an employee, go over a 
		checklist to make sure termination is necessary and that you are 
		protected from retaliation. Do you have a legitimate reason for 
		termination, and is there documentation to support it? Has someone 
		spoken to the employee up for termination to get his or her side of the 
		story? Have all potential witnesses been spoken to? Is the employee 
		being treated in a manner consistent with your employee handbook and 
		established practices? Has the business treated any other employees 
		differently who have committed the same offense? Has the employee 
		complained of discrimination, harassment, or failure to accommodate a 
		disability, and if so were those complaints addressed? Does the 
		discharge appear to be in retaliation for any previously filed 
		discrimination claims or &quot;whistleblowing?&quot; Should the employee be 
		offered the opportunity to resign in exchange for a valid release of any 
		potential claims? Actions during and following termination are just as 
		important as preparation. Make sure to have a management witness present 
		when communicating the decision, and truthfully state the reasons for 
		termination. Be sure to comply with applicable wage payment laws, 
		severance policies, administration of benefits, and insurance law 
		requirements. Consider offering post-termination benefits in return for 
		a release, and review and possibly obtain counsel with regard to any 
		proposed responses to inquiries from unemployment compensation agencies 
		to maintain consistency with previously stated reasons for the 
		discharge.<br />

		<i>Kansas City Star (07/21/08) Goforth, Alan</i> <br />
		<br />
		Many small businesses are feeling the pinch from a shaky economy, 
		climbing prices, and low consumer confidence. Small business experts say 
		small businesses looking to survive difficult times must react to the 
		times and stay nimble, watch their costs, and be innovative. Innovation 
		does not mean reinventing the company, but rather looking for new ways 
		to sell products or services and expanding to new markets. Last month, 
		for the first time since the early 1980s, small business owners cited 
		inflation as their leading worry in a monthly survey conducted by the 
		National Federation of Independent Business, with rising fuel costs 
		cited as a particular concern. Fortunately, access to business credit in 
		this tight economy is not a major concern for most small business 
		owners. In the survey, 35 percent of small business owners reported 
		regular borrowing activity, which is a typical result in surveys taken 
		over the past 15 years. Only 2 percent of owners cited the cost and 
		availability of business credit as their No.1 business problem.<br />

		Generation</b><br />
		<i>Las Cruces Sun-News (NM) (07/14/08)</i> <br />
		<br />
		The Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) offers several tips to 
		help small businesses develop plans for long-term growth. SCORE says 
		that ongoing business planning is critical for operating in a 
		continuously changing business environment that can offer unanticipated 
		opportunities as well as challenges. A small business should return to 
		the business plan every quarter or six months to compare projections 
		with current realities, update as needed, and adjust expectations for 
		milestones. Small businesses should keep a close watch on financial 
		statements by comparing actual cash flow to projections, so that they 
		can uncover any opportunities to improve performance. They should also 
		follow world and community events; study their sales records; and 
		communicate with customers, suppliers, and colleagues so they are not 
		caught off guard by the fast-moving global economy. Building 
		relationships with businesses in your field and specialty consultants 
		can offer a cost-effective way to address immediate and long-term needs. 
		And passing some routine and management responsibilities to certain 
		employees can give the owner of a growing small business extra time to 
		focus on other key matters. Also, entrepreneurs should discuss their 
		plans with a mentor, and ask for advice.<br />

		bakery like a professional, even though she does not rely on a marketing 
		company or a public relations firm and has no advertising budget. 
		Scherber, founder and owner of Amy&#39;s Bread in New York City, keeps in 
		contact with friends from high school, and her notoriety among her 
		alumni community has soared after she was nominated for Alumnus of the 
		Year and took home the award in 2005. She is also involved in her alumni 
		network from St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., and hosting an event 
		for an alum has also boosted the profile of the business among the 
		school&#39;s graduates. Scherber develops business relationships with 
		editors at publications before calling them about potential stories, 
		provides members of the media with the latest news when they come by to 
		buy bread, and mingles with reporters at food industry events. &quot;I don&#39;t 
		bombard the media with my ideas,&quot; Scherber says. &quot;It&#39;s better to know 
		what kind of stories they like and be selective when you call them.&quot; And 
		joining groups such as Women Chefs &amp; Restaurateurs and the Bread Bakers 
		Guild of America has given the business more visibility among Scherber&#39;s 
		peers. She also spends about $2,000 to $3,000 a year on items she sells 
		in her three retail stores, such as T-shirts.<br />

		<a name="370457"></a><b>Strategy Matters: 5 Reasons Why Strategy Fails</b><br />
		<i>bMighty.com (07/02/08) Merchant, Nilofer</i> <br />
		<br />
		Following a previously successful small business strategy can help your 
		company grow, but it is also important to understand why strategies 
		fail, writes Rubicon Consulting CEO Nilofer Merchant. Unsuccessful 
		strategies fail because there is a mismatch and people can be fearful or 
		get confused if they have information that contradicts the strategy. 
		When a strategy does not mesh with what employees know is true, they may 
		wonder if they should go along with the strategy or speak up and make 
		others aware of the problems. When employees doubt whether they should 
		make others aware of problems, the strategy has already failed. Second, 
		strategies often fail because of a lack of team involvement. Businesses 
		need to understand that strategies must be deployed at every level, as 
		often it is people lower in an organization&#39;s structure that will be 
		able to identify problems with a strategy, make others aware of the 
		problems, and create solutions to the problems. Another problem is that 
		people may try to implement a strategy without understanding where the 
		strategy comes from and what its true purpose is. Even the idea of 
		&quot;flawless execution&quot; assumes there is a target everyone is striving for, 
		but it is rare to find such uniformly aligned goals among employees in 
		any business. A good strategy reinforces the ability of people in an 
		organization to synchronize, know how to adjust, make good decisions, 
		and feed information back into the system for fine tuning. Lastly, poor 
		decision making can ruin a strategy if the people in the organization do 
		not see these bad decision as the source of failure. Too many goals or 
		conflicting imperatives create situations where every objective is top 
		priority, meaning the truly important goals are lost in the crowd and 
		nothing really gets accomplished.<br />

		<br />
		The Internet offers small businesses a variety of opportunities to 
		expand their business and engage customers. The Internet has become a 
		place for consumers to share information and experiences, and some may 
		be discussing their experience with your business, both the good and the 
		bad. Consumers trust each other more than they trust advertisers or 
		businesses, which makes online reviews an incredibly powerful feature 
		that can affect any business. Small businesses are particularly 
		dependent on favorable testimonials and word of mouth, so a negative 
		review or comment about a business online can be very detrimental. The 
		key to making online reviews, both the good and the bad, work for your 
		small business is to monitor conversations about your brand. Tools such 
		as Google Alerts can be used to monitor the Internet for mentions of 
		your company name. Blog search engines can also be used to find what 
		people are writing about your business. You can use negative reviews to 
		identify and fix problems in your business you otherwise might have 
		missed. If your business is being unfairly criticized, it is important 
		to respond in a professional manner. For example, if a blog is 
		wrongfully accusing your staff of being unethical, write a post 
		explaining your side of the experience, and provide a link to your 
		ethics policy. You can also maintain your own blog to find out what 
		customers think about your business, but be sure to write about your 
		business honestly, discussing both the positives and areas you know your 
		business needs improvement, to maintain your credibility as a blogger.<br />

		<i>Kiplinger Letter (07/15/08) Craver, Martha Lynn</i> <br />
		<br />
		The health care packages that several states have enacted to assist 
		small business owners in providing insurance to employees are less 
		costly measures that provide subsidies, tax deductions, and affordable 
		plans. Florida is the latest state to offer basic policies to employers 
		with 50 or fewer employees in effort to keep costs down. South Carolina 
		will allow 10 or more companies with at least 50 employees to join 
		together and negotiate for lower rates. Oklahoma, where the state and 
		employers cover 60 percent and 25 percent of the cost, respectively, is 
		expanding eligibility for its program to employers that have up to 250 
		employees and raising the income cap for workers. In Alabama, businesses 
		with fewer than 25 workers will be able to deduct 150 percent of what 
		they pay for premiums from their state income taxes, and employees who 
		earn $50,000 or less annually will be able to deduct 150 percent of what 
		they pay for health insurance. Small business owners are unlikely to see 
		bigger reforms until the economy rebounds and state revenues improve.<br />

		<i>Forbes (07/22/08) Rao, Dileep</i> <br />
		<br />
		Small businesses exist in all manner of industries, but working capital 
		is a constant constraint for every small business, and many are finding 
		traditional revenues for capital to be unavailable, writes Carlson 
		School of Management professor Dileep Rao. Regional banks, having rushed 
		head long into the subprime lending disaster, are trying to recoup 
		losses by increasing rates on other loans and credit cards. Meanwhile, 
		the Small Business Administration is cutting back on SBA loans, and 
		putting the burden on entrepreneurs to shoulder more of the risk. The 
		U.S. venture capital (VC) industry is also shrinking, with the number of 
		VC funds in the United States falling to 844 from about 1,200 at the 
		beginning of the century. Rao says these pullbacks in traditional 
		funding mean entrepreneurs and small business need to find other

		capital they need to expand and improve their business.<br />

		<a name="373106"></a><b>Strategies: How to Keep Your Business Bank 
		Accounts Safe</b><br />
		<i>USA Today (07/25/08) Abrams, Rhonda</i> <br />
		<br />
		The recent collapse of a major U.S. bank highlights the need to 
		understand the federal government&#39;s deposit insurance protections. The 
		U.S. government, through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), 
		protects up to $100,000 per individual, but that applies to all accounts 
		an individual has at any one bank, including both business and personal 
		accounts if the individual is the sole proprietor. Small businesses can 
		easily have more than $100,000 in their business bank accounts, which 
		can include a business checking account, a money market account, and a 
		certificate of deposit. Some retail operations and restaurants can have 
		tens of thousands of dollars going through a bank account every month 
		that could quickly exceed $100,000. Additionally, many small business 
		owners use the same bank for their business and personal accounts, as it 
		is easier, and often necessary, to transfer funds between accounts. To 
		make sure all your assets are protected, it is important to know a few 
		specifics. The FDIC covers only $100,000 per bank per &quot;entity,&quot; which 
		includes individuals, corporations, and legal partnerships, each of 
		which can have separate FDIC insurance up to the $100,000 limit. Sole 
		proprietorships are not separate entities from the individual, so if 
		your business is not incorporated or a LLC, your business accounts are 
		not covered separately from your personal accounts. However, if a spouse 
		is on a personal account, he or she is also insured up to $100,000. 
		Legal corporations, LLCs, and legal partnerships are separate entities. 
		A legal partnership is a single entity with a $100,000 insurance limit, 
		no matter how many partners are in the legal partnership. If you have 
		more than $100,000 in all your business and personal accounts, consider 
		switching some funds to another FDIC-insured bank.<br />

		Return on investment (ROI) is a term well known to small business 
		owners, but many do not know how to properly apply ROI analysis. ROI is 
		a performance metric designed to help gauge the efficiency of an 
		investment or to compare the efficacy of a number of different 
		investments. ROI is calculated using the expected benefit or return from 
		an investment divided by the associated expenses, with the tally 
		expressed as a percentage or ratio. ROI can be applied to almost any 
		scenario, and its straight forward approach makes it a popular 
		measurement, though it is a very general way of calculating potential 
		profitability in an investment. For example, a ROI analysis can be used 
		to evaluate a proposed investment in new equipment for your small 
		business. A company may be able to save $5,000 in operating expenses, 
		and raise profit by that amount, by spending $25,000 on new equipment. 
		By dividing the increase in profit new equipment would bring, by the 
		expenditure of capital needed to acquire the equipment, a business can 
		determine its ROI. If the ROI is greater than the cost of the capital 
		prior to making the purchase, and if there are no other investment 
		opportunities for those funds, buying the new equipment may be a good 
		choice. When using ROI analysis, remember that ROI calculations can be 
		easily manipulated to suit a specific purpose as the calculation is 
		subject to whatever one choose to count as associated costs and returns. 
		Furthermore, business owners often fail to comprehend the actual scope 
		of a business investment, which creates skewed ROI calculations, and 
		many business owners fail to assign the proper value to their own time, 
		which should be calculated along with cash and other human resources.<br />

		Don&#39;t put away your sunscreen when summer ends. Fall is a great time to 
		escape to an all-inclusive resort in the Caribbean or Mexico, as many 
		drop their rates to attract more visitors during the slower travel 
		season. For under $1,200, you can score a great seven-night, 
		mid-September getaway for two at the following six resorts. (The prices 
		are courteous of www.ResortVacationsToGo.com and do not include 
		airfare.) Iberostar Punta Cana is a four-star resort in Punta Cana, 
		Dominican Republic, and boasts a beachside bar, multiple buffets, and a 
		bevy of activities, including lessons in Spanish, meringue, archery, and 
		diving. The trip will cost you $1,063. Also in the Dominican Republic is 
		ClubHotel Riu Bachata. You will pay $760 and may also take advantage of 
		the amenities, recreation, and restaurants at adjacent Riu Mambo and Riu 
		Merengue. All the traditional resort activities are available, and the 
		Caribbean Street promenade boasts a very of stores, a spa, and a gym. 
		Snacks are offered around the clock, buffets feature cooking stations 
		for customized ordering for three meals a day, and rooms boast minibars 
		and liquor dispensers. Point Village is also in the Caribbean, but over 
		in Jamaica. The three-star resort, priced at $969, has a freshwater 
		swimming pool in addition to natural rock pools filled with seawater. 
		Guests can dine buffet-style in the resort&#39;s main dining area, at one of 
		its restaurants, or out on the beach on Wednesday evenings when the 
		resort throws a beach bash. If you&#39;d rather head to Mexico, check out 
		the Barcelo Costa Cancun in—you guessed it—Cancun. Kayaking, pedal boat 
		outings, snorkeling, and a free scuba lesson are all included in the 
		price, which is $1,190. The resort is kid-friendly as guests 5 or 
		younger stay free, and children ages 6 to 12 pay discounted rates. The 
		site offers four restaurants. Over in Cozumel, Mexico, is the 4.5-star 
		Melia Cozumel, for $1,008. It offers a wide range of recreation for 
		active guests, a spa, informal classes, and a golf course. Eat at one of 
		the resort&#39;s two specialty restaurants and enjoy a cocktail at one of 
		five bars. Another 4.5-star resort in Mexico is Riu Vallarta in Puerto 
		Vallarta. For $887, socialize at a number of lounges or the nightclub, 
		eat at one of the restaurant&#39;s or special-themed buffets, take advantage 
		of the beach activities, and use the amenities or dine at sister resort

		<a name="362872"></a><b>Buying a Gas Grill: What You Need to Know</b><br />
		<i>Food &amp; Wine (06/08) Vol. 31, No. 6, P. 84; Quinlan, Christine</i>
		<br />
		<br />
		It is often said &quot;you get what you pay for,&quot; but you can get a good gas 
		grill for $300, $1,000, or $5,000, as long as you know what you are 
		looking for. If you are shopping for a $300 grill, search hard for one 
		made of all stainless steel, as these will be the most durable, as well 
		as one that has tube-shaped burners, rather than U-shaped or circular 
		burners, because they heat more evenly. It might be hard to find a $300 
		grill with side burners, but it is not impossible. Also, look for a 
		grill with cooking grates made from stainless steel or porcelain-coated 
		cast iron. Grills at this price level will almost always feature knob or 
		push-button ignitions and will be large enough to grill food for four 
		people. If you are willing to spend $1,000, you should have no problem 
		finding a grill made entirely of stainless steel. Use a magnet to test 
		the grade. If the magnet sticks to the grill it indicates that the 
		stainless steel is lower quality, so look for one where it will not 
		stick. Other things to look for, but that are not always included, are 
		rubber wheels with a full axle, individually-controlled tube-shaped 
		burners, side burners, a smoker or a rotisserie, grates made of 
		stainless steel or cast iron, and electronic ignition. Grills at this 
		price level will be larger in size and be big enough to cook for eight 
		to 10 people. If you are ready to spend $5,000, search for high-grade 
		stainless steel grills made in the United States by hand with welded 
		seams, which extends a grill&#39;s lifetime. Some grills at this price offer 
		the option of switching between gas and charcoal or wood, while others 
		feature infrared burners for high-heat searing, as well as basic 
		burners. Most of the time, the cooking grates will be made from 
		stainless steel, otherwise, cast iron. All $5,000 grills should be able 
		to cook for 12 to 15 people and should include a battery-powered 
		electronic ignition, side burners, roomy smoker boxes, rotisseries, 
		halogen lights inside the hood for grilling at night, built-in trays to 
		hold condiments, spacious side shelves, and built-in storage space. 
		Also, when shopping, remember that the more expensive the grill, the 
		longer its warranty.<br />
