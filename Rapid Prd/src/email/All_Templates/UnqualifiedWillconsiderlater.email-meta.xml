Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for your interest in RapidAdvance. We are pleased to inform you that you are eligible for our cash advance service pending further payoff of your existing cash advance.  We will contact you once your current outstanding cash advance balance has been reduced to 50% of your requested amount from RapidAdvance (i.e. If you are requesting $20,000 from RapidAdvance, then the remaining balance on your existing cash advance needs to be less than $10,000).  At that time, we will pay off your remaining balance and fund you the difference.
 
We look forward to providing you with additional working capital in the near future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Credit Committee</textOnly>
