    <subject>I think we found your funding solution</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This is {!User.FirstName} from RapidAdvance.  I see that we got pretty far into the process of funding your business, but did not ultimately move forward.

I wanted to reconnect with you to see what we can do to get you the financing you were looking for. We have recently revamped some of our products and programs and I think we have some solutions that will meet your specific needs..

Please call me back at 877-252-9728 at your earliest convenience.

You can reach me in the office tonight until 8pm EST.

Thank you and I look forward to speaking with you soon!
