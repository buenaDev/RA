    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I just wanted to check and see if everything is alright. I’ve been trying to get a hold of you for a few days, but we haven’t been able to connect yet.

Is there anything I can answer for you?

Give me a call at 877-252-9728 and let’s talk about how we can help your business!

Thank you.
