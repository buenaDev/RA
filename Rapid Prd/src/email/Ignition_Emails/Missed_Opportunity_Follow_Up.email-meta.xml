Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This is {!User.FirstName} from RapidAdvance. I understand we ran into some challenges the last time we spoke, but I’ve got good news! We’ve rolled out some new products that are geared specifically towards your industry! I wanted to have a quick phone conversation to see how we can help your business out now. Give me a call back at {!User.Phone]. I will be here in the office until 8:00 EST. I look forward to speaking with you!
