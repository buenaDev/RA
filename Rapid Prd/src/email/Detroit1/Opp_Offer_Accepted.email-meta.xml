    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I’d like to get you your funds as soon as possible – but you haven’t sent me the signed agreement we discussed.

As soon as you do, I can send it to our underwriting team to finish processing your request.

Call me today at {!User.Phone} if you have any questions. I’m looking forward to helping your business grow.

Sincerely,
{!User.Name}</textOnly>
