    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Hope all is well with business right now. I tried giving you a call a little bit ago and it looks like I caught you at a bad time. I was reaching out to you today with an amazing opportunity for your business.



Earlier this month we rolled out a brand new product called our “Preferred Loan” and this product is by far the most economical loan that we’ve ever built. The interest rates on our “Preferred Loan” are 1.25% per month for the duration of the loan, the best in our entire industry. With you being a former closed client of ours we felt that it was only right to let you get first crack at this opportunity.  I was looking for about 5 minutes of your time to take a look at your business with you and see if it’s a fit. Please let me know when you are available for a short conversation. You may also reach out to me at any time on either phone number below.



Looking forward to hearing back from you soon!
