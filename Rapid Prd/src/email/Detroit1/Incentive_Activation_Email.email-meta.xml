    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Your card has been activated! You can now use it everywhere VISA® debit cards are accepted.

Thank you again for choosing RapidAdvance – I am excited to help your business grow with our funding solutions.

You shouldn’t have any issues using the card, but here are some frequently asked questions that may help you get started:

Should I choose credit or debit when using this card?
Even though this is a prepaid debit card, always choose &quot;credit&quot; when using it.

Will I receive a Personalized Identification Number (PIN)?
No, but you may request a PIN by visiting ReadyPerks.com.

Can I use this card at an ATM?
These cards are not accepted at ATMs, and cannot be used to access cash or obtain cash back in any purchase transaction.

Can I purchase fuel with this card?
Definitely, but it’s best to use this card inside rather than paying at the pump, since some pumps may not accept the card and others may place a hold on any remaining balance.

Where can I access my account information?
You can call (866) 295-3380 or visit ReadyPerks.com.</textOnly>
