Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I noticed you have paid off your entire loan balance. Congratulations!
Do you know about our renewal benefits program?  The majority of our clients that have reached this point in their payback are taking advantage of this new opportunity.

In short, we are usually able to renew your loan with a better rate than your first loan and in a lot of cases, we are able to fund you more capital without having your payment increase at all. How do you think this might help your business?

Do you have 10 minutes to catch up tomorrow?
Thank you! Hope to talk soon!
