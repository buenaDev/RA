    <textOnly>Hey {!Contact.FirstName},

Hope all is well with you today! My name is {!User.Name} and I’m a Business Advisor at Rapid Advance, a sister company of Quicken Loans. Quicken Loans believes in providing the highest level of service to all of our clients and I was reaching out regarding a special opportunity we have for small business financing. We noticed you were self employed and there is a very good chance that you qualify for our low rate preferred loan product.

Just to give you an idea of what it is we are offering, it&apos;s a loan that is as competitive as a bank loan or SBA loan in terms and rates, with the only difference being we don’t require the crazy documentation that banks and government loans will require from you.  We also don’t have the high cost fees because we will be servicing your loan through the life of the loan.

I am just looking for about 5-10 minutes of your time to see if this make sense for you. When would be the best time for you to talk?

Thanks,
