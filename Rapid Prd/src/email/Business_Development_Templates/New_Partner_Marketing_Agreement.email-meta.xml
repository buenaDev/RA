    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},



It was a pleasure to speak with you today. As discussed I have attached the marketing agreement and W9 form. Please review the marketing agreement, initial, sign, and send it back to me. I will also need you to fill out the W9 form and send it back to me with a voided business check. Once I receive the signed agreement I will contact you for the webinar. Let me know if you have any questions.




Regards,
