How to Create a Smart Credit Policy

 For most small companies, operating without business credit or without offeringtrade credit is not an option. However, granting credit does have
costs, including the expense of working capital, the actual cost of
borrowing or the opportunity cost of lending, the administrative costs
of creating statements and collection, and the possibility that some
customer debt will go bad. A business can mitigate much of these costs
by creating a strong credit policy and carefully managing accounts
receivable. Creating a good credit policy starts with creating a
relationship with your sales strategy. More aggressive goals require a
looser credit policy. Whatever your goals, the particulars should match
the standards in your market and your industry. Business-to-business
lending generally uses two kinds of credit. Open credit does not
require a down payment, and levies no interest or carrying charges,
with the payment being due in full on the specified date, generally 30
days after goods are delivered. Revolving credit sets a limit on how
much a customer can borrow, and the customer pays interest only on the
principal borrowed, so that as debt is repaid the credit available
increases. Create guidelines for granting credit, as the amount of
credit you grant, and who receives that credit, must reflect you
tolerance for risk. While it may seem best to avoid taking any risk,
doing so may increase your market share or win customers that will
bring additional business. Furthermore, a large profit margin can allow
a lender to come out ahead even if the customer later defaults. Be
vigilant in managing your books. Be concerned if your average
collection period is a third longer than the period established in your
credit terms. Zero in on individual customers and regularly monitor
purchase patterns, average days to payment, and changes in the payment pattern. Update and review credit files for all accounts at least
semiannually, and get new financial statements every two years.

Tax Season Tips for Your Business

 Every year tax laws are slightly different, and small business owners need to be sure they know how to deal with a variety of tax issues, such as small business loans, and, this year, the tax implications in the economic stimulus plan. The Internal Revenue Service Web site is an excellent resource that provides forms and answers to frequently asked questions.
The site even features a Small Business and Self-Employed Tax Center
for specific questions, such as what expenses can be deducted. The
stimulus bill increased the small business capital-gains exclusion from
50 percent to 75 percent. The IRS defines capital gains as &quot;almost
everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure, or
investment,&quot; and stresses that you must report all capital gains. The
stimulus bill also extends carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs)
for small businesses to five years for NOLs starting in the 2008 and
2009 taxable years for businesses that average $15 million or less in
annual gross receipts. Depreciation of capital expenditures also has
changed. Last year, Congress temporarily allowed the recovery of costs
of capital expenditures made in 2008 at an accelerated rate by allowing
businesses to immediately write off 50 percent of the cost of
depreciable property acquired in 2008 for use in the United States.
Businesses that create jobs for unemployed veterans or youth that have
been out of work or school for the past six months also can receive a
tax credit. Keep all business receipts throughout the entire year, even
if they are all filed in the same place and only sorted out for tax
purposes. Get your paperwork, including W2s, 1099s, and possibly
Schedule K-1s, if there are multiple owners in an LLC, together as soon
as possible so you can find or replace anything that is missing.

Deals Abound for Secondhand Equipment

Many small businesses are taking advantage of the struggling economy by using their working capital or obtaining business loans or credit to
purchase a wide variety of high-quality secondhand technology. &quot;Lots of
companies are shutting down operations, so lots of fairly new products
are ending up on the secondary market,&quot; says consultant Rob Enderle.
Some equipment may even be in perfect condition, having been recovered from customer returns or orders that were canceled before being delivered. IBM, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard all sell refurbished laptops, desktop PCs, and other equipment, all of which is tested and sold with a guarantee. Buying used technology gear is a little like buying a used car, and a few precautions can greatly help avoid buying a bad piece of equipment. Some equipment may be sold needing additional repairs, though the repairs may be as simple and inexpensive as replacing a wireless card. Almost any device can be purchased secondhand, including desktops, laptops, telephone systems, and even servers, and some of the best bargains can be found on higher-end equipment such as routers and
switches, which can potentially save thousands of dollars when bought
used. Some experts suggest buying new desktops because the prices on
PCs have dropped drastically in recent years, and caution against
buying refurbished laptops because they can easily be beat up while
being carried around. Additionally, a used computer could contain old
data if the hard drive is not properly erased. Be sure to buy used
equipment from reputable firms with a physical address to avoid illegal
or operations. Pay close attention to warranties, and fully test all
equipment when it arrives so any malfunctioning equipment can be
returned.

Recession Solutions for the Small Business
To survive difficult times, small businesses need to think strategically
and re-examine how they do business. A significant majority of small
businesses, 70 percent to 80 percent, all have the same problems,
including a lack of sales, marketing, and financial and strategic
planning, or limited access to business capital or business credit,
says consultant Blair Koch. Koch says that making just a few
adjustments can help small businesses survive the recession. First,
implement well-defined job descriptions to create better productivity
and time management. Strong job descriptions give employees a sense of duty and will make them less likely to waste time on frivolous tasks.
Create structured business goals to refocus the direction of your
company and provide step-by-step guidelines. Encourage communication
and dialog within the company to generate ideas and bring in more
business. Capitalize on the diverse perspectives of all employees.
Instead of spending money on a professional focus group, host an event
for clients and local business managers to assess marketing techniques.
Provide free products in the form of white papers and other
complementary educational material to generate interest in your
company. But make sure to only offer free white papers for download
after the reader has submitted contact information, giving your company
a free list of prospective clients. Keep advertisements simple and
unobtrusive. Short messages from 
small businesses owners, not
professional announcers, can be used to update existing clients on
industry and investment news. Reduce unnecessary spending wherever
possible, and encourage employees to take time off during the slow
season instead of during peak times.

Strategies for Lowering Health Care Costs


Premiums on group healthcare policies have risen by as much as 30
percent, in addition to double-digit increases in each of the past five
years, and coverage is shrinking. Insurer consolidation means that
policy choices are more limited than ever, and the seller&apos;s market
gives small business owners little room to negotiate prices or terms.
Rising healthcare costs come at a time when sales and profit margins
are down, preventing small businesses from passing healthcare costs on
to their customers. Small businesses generally pay 18 percent more for
health insurance than large companies, and the number of small
businesses that provide health insurance is shrinking. However, many
entrepreneurs are finding innovative ways of covering themselves and
their employees, providing them with a competitive advantage. In some
states, small businesses have joined together to qualify for lower
group rates on insurance. For example, in Cleveland, companies with
fewer than 500 employees can buy health insurance through the Council
of Smaller Enterprises (COSE), a partner of the regional chamber of
commerce. COSE rates are about 8 percent lower than on the open market,
and about 14,000 companies participate in the pool. Other small
businesses are bypassing the health-insurance market and covering
employee medical costs directly, though this is risky and could expose
them to paying for lengthy illnesses and treatments. Health insurance
costs also can be pared in several ways, including encouraging
employees to switch to generic medications, taking preventative
measures during flu season, and limiting doctor visits for colds and
mild maladies. Some companies also penalize employees with unhealthy
habits such as smoking. Sixteen percent of the nation&apos;s largest
employers make workers who smoke contribute more to health-insurance
premiums.

11 Ways to Turnaround a Struggling Business

Although the economy is struggling, it is still possible to right a
struggling small business, and even position it for future growth, says
consultant Paul Rauseo. Rauseo has several suggestions to help
businesses stay afloat. First, keep selling. Purchasing agents have
been reporting significantly fewer weekly sales calls in several
industries, which means there is less competition. Rauseo says now is
an excellent time to hire sales professionals to work only on
commission. Instead of cutting advertising and marketing budgets,
establish controls that will allow the business to gauge the response
and adjust costs on a weekly basis. If a certain strategy is not
working, cut it quickly. Look for opportunities everywhere, such as new
small business loans. The economic stimulus plan is going to pump
massive amounts of money into the economy, so create a strategy to take advantage of the opportunity. Create a rapid response team that can anticipate the effects of the recession and react quickly. If a certain
item is not selling, get rid of it, and have delivery trucks pick up
orders instead of returning empty. Think of ways to sell products to
new industries. For example, Rauseo had a client who sold hinges to the
auto industry and was going under, but is now making hinges for caskets
and is recovering. Cutting staff may be inevitable, but avoid large
layoffs that will hurt morale and productivity. Significant layoffs may
make customers nervous that the business will not be able to handle a
large order. Look for alternative ways to cut costs and avoid layoffs,
such as shorter workweeks, pay cuts, or assigning extra
responsibilities. Be sure to tell employees that such measures will be
lifted once the company recovers. Stay in touch with customers, and
provide reports detailing the work that&apos;s been done for them and the
value that&apos;s been added to their operations, and be sure to ask how you
can serve them better.

Real-World Cost-Cutting Practices

 The
recession has forced almost all small businesses to find ways of
cutting costs, including laying off employees, postponing future
projects, and canceling large purchases. The smartest companies have
found ways of adapting their business practices and are saving energy,
finding free advertising, entertaining clients inexpensively, and
saving money in innovative and productive ways. Switching to green
products, such as napkins, paper towels, and toilet paper, for example,
can save companies 10 percent to 15 percent. Sending employees home
during slow periods is an excellent way to save without cutting staff.
If an employee makes $10 an hour, sending one employee home for one
hour a day saves $3,650 a year. Electronic marketing also can lower
costs, as can shopping for wholesale supplies. For businesses with
vehicles, educating drivers on fuel conservation can go a long way and
help companies avoid the need to get small business loans to cover
operating expenses. Instruct drivers to shut of engines whenever
possible, eliminate jack-rabbit stops, and drive more conservatively to
maintain a steady speed. Installing speed governors is a one-time cost
that can save significant amounts of fuel on longer drives by ensuring
drivers do not exceed the most efficient speeds. Re-working delivery
routes also can save money by avoiding route overlaps and or sections
without stops. Voice-over Internet protocol communications can save on
Internet and phone costs, and many firms offer free Website-hosting
plans. Instead of holding business meetings over lunch, hold meetings
over coffee at a coffee shop, which is far less expensive than a full
meal.

How to Keep Customers Coming Back

Serving
customers is the top priority for small businesses, and creating strong
customer relations will ensure that customers come back. Leo Tilman,
author of &quot;Financial Darwinism&quot; says that small businesses should help
clients separate themselves from their competitors, achieve their most
pressing objectives, and turn risk into opportunity. This assistance
can come in many forms, including small business loans, extending
business credit, or custom products. Serving customers well will keep
them coming back for decades. Best Western&apos;s Ron Pohl says small
businesses should create a strong relationship with customers from the
start, which can include over delivering. &quot;When you first acquire a
client, it&apos;s important to over deliver, especially on the first
project,&quot; says Mixercast CEO Jennifer Cooper. &quot;Ideally you&apos;ll
over deliver on all projects, but it&apos;s critical that you build rapport,
exceed expectations, and establish the relationship out of the gate.&quot;
Be sure not to violate a customer&apos;s trust, and maintain a high level of
service to retain customers. Offer incentives so customers feel like
they are always getting a deal, as it is easier to retain customers
than find new ones. Be innovative and adjust to meet customer demands.
Be accessible to clients, respond to all inquiries by the end of
business, and solicit feedback from clients to understand their needs
and create effective solutions.

Freebies and Special Deals Generate New Business


More and more small businesses are attempting to draw new customers
through giveaways and other special offers and incentives, often with
the help of small business loans. Consultant Barbara Apple Sullivan
says this strategy could yield dividends, not only winning customers
but also facilitating greater long-term success if the customers are
willing to pay full price for the products or services in the future.
Vaillant Solar Systems in San Diego rolled out a program in which it
installs residential solar hot-water heating systems for no upfront
cost, while homeowners cover part of the installation through tax
credits. Vaillant says homeowners can have the company cover that cost
initially and pay back the firm at tax time, or they can embed the
amount of the credits into monthly payments. The remaining balance is
reimbursed from the savings customers realize on their energy bills.
Specialty gift store Zazu of Virginia decided to drop mass advertising
and establish a blog where giveaways are periodically posted, and store
co-owner Steven Haddad says this strategy is fueling interest that
leads to more online sales. Meanwhile, software maker Infusionsoft
launched a promotion that allows customers to request a refund for
upfront costs if the software fails to help them double sales in a
12-month period. The majority of Infusionsoft&apos;s customers are small
companies with less than 10 employees, and CEO Clate Mask says a small
company has a better chance of doubling sales partly because the firm
tries to target expanding businesses with working capital. Infusionsoft
signed up 223 new customers in the first month of the promotion. The
fledgling Ficion Audio in Washington state introduced a promotion
allowing customers to return their speakers for 90 percent of the sales
price if they become unemployed within one year.

Some Businesses Are Thriving

 Businesses in the
United States are currently experiencing the worst economic conditions
in 70 years, but some industries are still prospering. Comfort food
companies and money-saving product manufacturers are experiencing
strong sales. For example, Skinner Baking in Omaha saw its 2008 sales
revenue rise 18 percent over 2007, and in December sales increased a
record 25 percent. Skinners makes coffeecakes, fruit-filled Danish,
cinnamon buns, and other baked sweets that are sold at supermarkets
nationwide. Small businesses in these industries may want to find some
form of small business financing and use this time as an opportunity to
expand. While the nation&apos;s automakers, big banks, and retailers are in
a downward spiral, other companies are setting sales records because
they offer products and services that help consumers save money. &quot;The
role of entrepreneurs might be even more important during a recession,&quot;
says University of Michigan-Flint economics professor Mark Perry.
&quot;Their ability to be nimble and innovative and adapt to change become
key advantages.&quot; During the previous recession in 2001 and 2002, the
U.S. economy lost nearly 2.7 million jobs, but new and existing
businesses with fewer than 20 employees gained 853,074 jobs during that
period, according to the Small Business Administration.

10 Great Places to See Skylines of the World

Photographer James Blakeway, author of &quot;Skylines of the World,&quot; shares
some of his favorite cityscape views. A ride up the Duquesne Incline in
Pittsburgh provides a sweeping view of the city&apos;s unique, older bridges
that span the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which meet to form the
Ohio River. In Australia, the Sydney ferries provide a tour of some of
the most recognizable architecture in the world, including the Sydney
Opera House, and can provide an excellent view of the entire city from
the harbor. Queen Anne Hill in Kerry Park in Seattle offers a sweeping
view of the landscape, as far as Mount Rainier on a clear day. Point
Bonita in Marin County, Calif., is an excellent spot for viewing San
Francisco&apos;s skyline, and the city&apos;s two most distinct features&amp;#8212;the
Golden Gate Bridge and the Oakland Bay Bridge. In London, the London
Eye, a 443-foot Ferris Wheel on the Thames, gives riders bird&apos;s-eye
views of Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament, and Big Ben. Hamilton
Park in Weehawken, N.J., is on a cliff overlooking the Hudson, and in
the evening the sun sets behind anyone looking across the Hudson to New
York City, so the light bounces off of all the buildings. For a great
view of Chicago, go to the Adler Planetarium and walk along the water.
The best view of Paris, which contains such historic architecture as
the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Basilica of Sacre-Coeur, can be
found at the Montparnasse Tower on the Left Bank, which is one of the
city&apos;s only skyscrapers. In Las Vegas, the observation deck on top of
the 1,149-foot-high Stratosphere tower and casino provides a
breathtaking view of the city&apos;s lights. Finally, in Bergen, Norway, an
old fishing and shipping village that has managed to preserve some
centuries-old commercial buildings, the Floibanen provides rides to the
top of Mount Floyen for an amazing panoramic view.

Theme Parks Offering Great Deals

 If you have
been postponing a Disney vacation because of an aversion to long lines
and high prices, now may be the time to take that trip. Attendance at
Disney&apos;s parks started falling at the end of 2008, dropping about 5
percent from the previous year, and the company is now offering
unprecedented deals to keep attendance up. Walt Disney World Resort in
Florida is offering a seven-night vacation package at one of its 23
on-site hotels for the price of four nights, including admission to the
park. With the exception of a few blackout dates, the deal has been
extended through August 15th, and guests who book a deal for early or
late March will receive a $200 gift card for Disney merchandise or
dining. In California, Disneyland is offering several packages,
including two-night stays that feature gift cards and adult tickets at
the children&apos;s price and a children-fly-free deal through Alaska
Airlines. Both parks also are offering free admission to active or
retired military personnel who visit on their birthdays. Some of
Disney&apos;s competitors also have introduced value packages, including a
five-nights-for-the-price-of-three deal at Universal Orlando Resort,
Worlds of Discovery, which includes SeaWorld and Busch Gardens. These
bargains give families more options to travel on a limited budget.
Regional parks such as Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, and Six Flags,
which has 20 parks across the United States, Mexico, and Canada, also
are offering reduced prices to attract visitors. &quot;We recognize families
are watching their budget more than ever before,&quot; says Six Flags
spokesperson Sandra Daniels. &quot;We want to be an economical value.&quot;
