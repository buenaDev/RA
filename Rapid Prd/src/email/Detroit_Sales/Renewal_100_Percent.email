Hi,

My name is (BA). I am a Business Advisor with our Client Loyalty team here at RapidAdvance. I work on a team that specifically works with returning clients. Congrats on great performance with our loan! It looks like you have gotten to the point where you have paid off your entire loan balance. The majority of our clients that have reached this point in their payback are taking advantage of a renewal.

This means that we are able to redo your loan with a better rate than the first loan we did for you and in a lot of cases, we are able to fund you more capital without having your payment increase at all. 

What time can we talk today about some solutions for you and your business today?
