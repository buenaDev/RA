Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 

My name is (BA). I’m a Business Advisor with our Client Loyalty Team here at RapidAdvance. I’m reaching out to you today because I work side by side with your current Business Advisor (BA), and I would like to update you on your account. I’m reaching out to you because I was monitoring your account and thus far, you are off to a great start on your business loan with us! Have you been able to keep track of your account through our online portal? If not, I will send you a link to be able to do so.

Also, at this point you are more than halfway to the 50% mark of fully repaying your loan. At that point, we make additional funding available for those businesses with needs or opportunities they want to capitalize on. What do you have on the horizon that might require some additional funding in about 2 months? I want to make sure we schedule a follow up appointment so you can take advantage of this opportunity.

Talk soon,
