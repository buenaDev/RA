    <textOnly>Hi {Insert Client Name},

My name is {!User.Name} and I’m reaching out to you with some great news! It doesn’t look like we were able to fund a loan for you the first time we spoke. However, we pride ourselves in exhausting all possible solutions when it comes to helping out our clients.





We have joined together with several companies which has given us the opportunity to help a lot more clients than we used to be able to help. We have access to several different loan products that a lot of our clients are taking advantage of now.





Please call me or e-mail me before the end of the day today so I can get to work on finding the right solution for you.


Thank you,
