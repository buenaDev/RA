<strong>Pricing Changes That Boost Revenue</strong><br><br>




	
  
		
	
  

Cutting prices is a tempting option when trying to create new sales, but doing so raises some difficult dilemmas.  Offering deep discounts can threaten to cheapen a brand, and once prices are lowered raising them again can be a daunting prospect.  The decreased revenue also could make it difficult to pay off small business loans.  "I try to get my clients to think about where they want to be as a brand when things turn around," says consultant Frank Luby.  Instead of lowering the price of existing products, try offering a similar product that is less expensive.  For example, PearlParadise.com founder Jeremy Shepherd created a "luxury for less" line of pearl jewelry that he could sell to thrifty shoppers instead of lowering the price of his high-end pearls.  Instead of offering across the board discounts, offer moderate to mild discounts for first-time buyers to get them invested in your product, and then keep them loyal by offering them superior service and customer support.  Limited discounts get customers interested in your product without turning your brand into a discount brand.  Offering additional services for the same price and bundling services into packages also can be an effective way to be more competitive without cutting into revenue.<br />

<strong>How to Buy Hardware for Your Business</strong><br><br>





	
  
		
	
  

Small and medium businesses need to invest in hardware and infrastructure, but during such difficult economic times small business loans and investment capital can be difficult to come by.  Any purchases must be thoroughly researched to ensure that they are the right ones.  The recently passed stimulus bill can help small businesses, with Section 179 allowing businesses to deduct the cost of certain purchases, such as computer equipment.  Congress also has increased the amount businesses can write off from $125,000 to $250,000, but only through Dec. 31, 2009.  IBM's Ron Kline says the stimulus will allow small businesses to invest in hardware such as energy-efficient computers and servers.  "Firms that will be prepared to emerge will also be able to be competitive," Kline says.  A recent CDW IT Monitor study found that 78 percent of midsize companies and 82 percent of large companies plan to purchase hardware in the next six months, but only 32 percent of small businesses plan to do the same.  Some guidelines can help businesses make smart purchases during this difficult time.  A Cisco study found that customer engagement, connecting their employees, and making sure the business is secure are the top three priorities for businesses when making a purchase.  Cisco's Rick Moran recommends improving performance by investing in bandwidth, some type of mobile device, and storage capabilities.  When comparing prices, sometimes paying a little more is a smart idea.  "Make sure you buy good enough so you get quality and you get good support so that you have someone to call when it doesn't go right," Moran says.  Consider the monetary benefit of buying a piece of hardware, the return on investment, and focus on investing in reducing costs, managing risks, and improving service to your company and supply chain.<br />

<strong>Reducing Employee Costs Can Prevent Layoffs</strong><br><br>





	
  
		
	
  

With business credit frozen and companies unable to obtain business loans, many large businesses are resorting to layoffs, but small businesses are trying to avoid letting employees go.  For some companies it is a matter of pride and being able to say they have never laid off a worker, while for others it is a necessity, with each and every employee being absolutely vital to their operations.  "Many companies previously known for avoiding layoffs during past downturns are forced to make extreme sacrifices to resist pink slips now," says Southern Methodist University professor Mel Fugate.  Management should be the first to make these sacrifices, and when the economy improves, any employees who were forced to make concessions should be rewarded, Fugate says.  "Doing so will preserve employee commitment and performance not only in the new good times but also in future downturns," he says.  Some companies are implementing mandatory days off, in which an employee must take a day off from work without pay either once a week or once every other week.  Managers and owners in some companies have taken pay cuts of 25 percent to 30 percent.  "Our business is our people," says Matthew Zurn, general manager of Zurn Plumbing Service. "Trying to keep them in the company is our top priority. When the economy bounces back, we're going to need everybody."  Tightening up schedules, including not allowing employees to clock in early and encouraging them to clock out early, can save money.  Ask employees to come up with creative solutions.  For example, a dishwasher at Samovar Tea Lounge in San Francisco suggested switching to stainless steel drinking glasses, which saves the restaurant $3,000 a year because it no longer has to replace broken glasses.  If employees do not have enough work, ask them to volunteer their time at nonprofits and local organizations, for which the company will pay them for, as it looks good for the company and can help bring in new customers.<br />

<strong>Economy Prompts Small Businesses to Refocus</strong><br><br>




	
  
		
	
  

The economic crisis is bringing to light many flawed small business practices that had previously gone unnoticed.  For example, Kent Lewis, president of Anvil Media, a search-engine marketing agency, quickly learned that his top-down style of telling team members what to do instead of having a discussion on what to do was not working.  "Basically, I wasn't spending enough quality time with the team and, in a time of crisis, I chose to tell them what we're going to do instead of having a discussion about it," Lewis says.  "They didn't necessarily disagree with the direction I took, but the way I communicated absolutely freaked them out.  I lost connection with the team."  Many entrepreneurs are receiving wake-up calls during the recession, and are reworking their businesses to make them better.  A recent Intuit survey of 1,005 small business owners found that 89 percent still see opportunities for their businesses during the recession.  Simply being more hands-on and being able to monitor operations on a daily basis can improve customer satisfaction and product quality, as employees are both motivated and reassured by the presence of their leader.  Ask for constructive criticism from employees to learn what would make them happier and more productive, and talk to them about changes at the business to alleviate fears, such as a business cash advance or business loan.  "If I didn't have that information, I couldn't have understood how important it was and then made an action plan to change how I communicate," Lewis says.  "If not for the recession, not only would I have not had the feedback, but I also think some people, if other jobs were available, would have left the company."<br />

<strong>Nurture Marketing Helps Retain Customers</strong><br><br>





	
  
		
	
  

It is easier to keep an existing customer than it is to find new ones, but many businesses overlook customer relations and loyalty marketing.  A few simple steps can appropriately express your gratitude toward your customers and create personal connections that will sustain your business.  Starting with your 20 best customers, write personal notes expressing how much you appreciate their business and how important their loyalty and support have been to your success.  Send a nice gift as part of the thank you, be it something as simple as chocolates, an orchid, a book off the bestseller list, or something that relates to the business.  Invite customers to some type of event, such as a special speaker, a breakfast meeting, or another event to connect on a personal level.  Make phone calls to ask how your service is and if there is anything that you can do to improve your service or help them in any way.  If they do ask for some assistance, try doing some research for them to give them more information on their problem, or loan them a member of your staff for a short period to help solve their problem.  Also give them a referral to another business that may specialize in the area they need help.  Use a variety of information-gathering techniques to help you understand what their concerns are and how to alleviate those concerns, including short surveys, product presentations, focus group dinners, demonstrations and trials, and beta products or sites.<br />

<strong>How to Escape Bad Business Partners</strong><br><br>




	
  
		
	
  

Bad business partners can severely hinder a small business, cost the business clients, and cause difficulty when trying to obtain a small business loan.  The best way to eliminate bad business partners is to avoid them to begin with, and to solidly establish, in writing, the responsibilities of each partner early in the process.  Drafting an agreement does not have to be expensive, and boilerplate legal language can cover many of the details.  If you missed the opportunity to create such an agreement and are now in a less than perfect relationship, you may have to make sacrifices to get your partner to agree to a contract that establishes responsibilities.  If an agreement cannot be reached, offer to buy your partner out of the business, or have your partner buy you out.  Dividing up a business can be a lot like going through a divorce.  Agreements have to be made on who keeps what clients, who gets any property or infrastructure, and what will happen to the brand name, logo, and domain name and Web site.  Fortunately, if an agreement cannot be reached at all, the one upside to not having a formal arrangement is that you are able to walk away and start a competing business.<br />

<strong>SMBs Adopt New Strategies to Outlast Recession</strong><br><br>





	
  
		
	
  

The economic downturn is hitting small companies just as hard as large companies, but some small business owners say they are increasing sales while being forced to reexamine how they conduct business.  The February Discover Small Business Watch, which surveyed 1,000 firms with five or fewer employees, found that 60 percent of small firms said they are unlikely to be forced to shut down, 22 percent said they are somewhat likely, and 14 percent said they are very likely.  Slightly more than half, 54 percent, of small firms said they see conditions for their business getting worse, and 42 percent said they experienced temporary cash-flow issues during the past 90 days.  However, many firms are still optimistic.  "For a lot of us, things are not nearly as dire or grim as they are in the evening news," says Martin Simenc, president of Home Safety Service, a seven-person firm that installs safety features to protect children and improve accessibility for seniors.  Simenc says that sales have slowed, but their target demographic has been favorable to them, particularly in the senior sector of their business.  Victor Cheng, author of "The Recession-Proof Business," says that during a recession money is still being spent, but the reasons for spending money are different, and meeting those new reasons can be as easy as changing how you communicate or finding new ways to make your products relevant.  For example, a massage therapy business should refocus their advertising efforts to emphasize "stress reduction" instead of "pampering."  Branching into new areas using a business loan or credit also can help a company survive.<br />

<strong>Downtowns Are Opportunities to Grow</strong><br><br>





	
  
		
	
  

Instinct tells small business managers that during times of difficulty they should cut costs and hunker down until the trouble passes, focusing on just surviving the crisis.  However, that may be exactly what managers should not do.  President Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel recently echoed Machiavelli by saying, "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste."  Now more than ever is the best time for innovative entrepreneurs to expand and discover new opportunities that will lead to new business ventures.  Experts say that recessions have proven to support innovation in the past.  The iPod was launched in the months following 9/11 and the economic downturn, and during the Great Depression DuPont invested in neoprene and nylon, and Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments were launched.  Being innovative during difficult times is hard, but if an opportunity is articulated well, and is attractive to investors, business capital or a small business loan can be found.  Entrepreneurs must articulate their distinctiveness on three fundamental decisions: Where to play, how to deliver, and how to win.  Entrepreneurs also must be able to identify the needs of consumers during downturns and direct their efforts toward providing a product of value in those areas.  Downturns also frequently cause an underutilization of resources that could be available at a low cost, including employee talent and technology and materials that could be repurposed for new uses.  Making new ventures profitable is crucial to any business, and accomplishing this during a recession is difficult.  The most natural response is to cut employees, assets, and non-core businesses, but doing so often leads to the loss of valuable resources, customers, and capabilities, ultimately making the business less competitive and less profitable.<br />

<strong>Four Keys to Warding Off Challengers</strong><br><br>




	
  
		
	
  

Competition is a part of business, but smart small businesses do not make it easy for other companies to take their business away.  Some industries have high barriers to entry associated with fixed costs or other unique aspects of the industry that make it hard to enter and expand.  Airlines, the auto industry, and large chain stores tend to be difficult, while restaurants, nail and hair salons, and similar businesses can be started with nothing more than a small business loan.  Barriers are most clearly related to fixed costs, as the initial business capital needed to launch a business is substantial.  Any company looking to raise barriers for its competition should understand the four Rs: Regulation, reputation, regeneration, and real estate.  Regulation is used to protect consumers and ensure quality in certain industries, but it also can be used as a competitive weapon.  Regulations may be legitimate if the issues involve public safety or unfair competition, but be careful as any time the government is involved there is the potential for unwanted side effects.  A company's reputation is one of the best barriers to blocking competition, and it is largely in its own control.  Creating a loyal customer base and a strong brand name will elevate the small business above the competition and make it a leader in the field.  Regeneration, be it a new staff scheduling model, a faster shipping process, a new product or service, or some other change, keeps the business at the leading edge of the industry and will keep it one step ahead of competitors.  Finally, controlling real estate, whether it is Internet real estate such as bookmarks, domain names, email lists, and customer databases, or physical real estate, will keep the company and brand in the most prominent locations and make its products or services the first consumers will find.<br />

<strong>Align People With Strategies to Boost Your Business</strong><br><br>





	
  
		
	
  

For small business owners, even when things are running smoothly there is still work to be done to ensure that problems never arise.  Just as with health and car checkups, business owners need to make sure that everything within their control is in alignment.  Treating customers well is often brought up as an important element of a business, but it is equally important to treat employees well.  Both groups should be listened to, treated courteously, and be given clear expectations that will be met.  Make sure price and value are properly aligned, and that customers are being charged for the value of the product they receive, not the cost of its production.  If prices are too high, customers will leave, but if prices are lower than the value of the product they are receiving, they may wonder if something is wrong with the product.  If customers believe they are buying something of value, the price should reflect that belief.   The right products and services need to be going to the right customers.  Few businesses sell products that are right for everyone, but they all need to sell enough of what they offer to the right people to meet their financial goals and support growth.  Understanding why customers make their decisions to buy certain products will help you market those products to similar potential customers.  Make sure that all accounting and invoicing practices are being followed and kept up-to-date.  If necessary, make arrangements with customers to smooth out the peaks and valleys in your cash flow, and make sure your billing cycles are in alignment with your customers' account payable schedules.  Finally, make sure that your location and space meet your needs and your customers' expectations and convenience.  Even if location is not important to customers, make sure the appearance of your facilities is consistent with your marketing messages.  Strategic small business loans or business credit can be used to finance your initiatives.<br />

<strong>Finding the Charm of Cross-Country Rail Travel</strong><br><br>





	
  
		
	
  

Rising gas prices, greater security concerns, hassles at airports, and a more environmentally conscientious public have led to a revival in train travel.  Last year, Amtrak set a new record for ridership.  Train travel provides excellent opportunities to see the country and make stops in cities along the way, including some remote towns and cities that are not conveniently available by plane.  In the United States, the Cardinal runs three days a week from New York to Chicago, before heading west.  The California Zephyr runs daily from Chicago to Emeryville, Calif., with passengers riding on double-decker trains with wraparound windows in an observation car.  The full trip can take less than four days, and takes riders on a historical and geographical tour of the country, including the industrial Northeast, Washington, Civil War Virginia, Chicago, the Rocky Mountains, red rock canyons, the Nevada desert, the Sierra Nevada, and San Francisco bay.  Sleeper room upgrades and multistop itineraries can be booked when the trip is reserved.  Extended trips, up to 45 days, also are available.  Similar train trips can be found abroad.  In Canada, the VIA Rail's cross-country service visits the lakes in northern Ontario, the Saskatchewan and Manitoba prairies, and the Canadian Rockies on a three-day, four-night trip.  In New Zealand, a 423-mile, 12-hour journey from Auckland to Wellington on the Overlander travels the lush area of New Zealand's North Island, featuring farming hamlets, snow-covered volcanoes, and rivers.  The Glacier Express in Switzerland is a breathtaking, seven-and-a-half-hour trip through the Swiss Alps that features 291 bridges, 91 tunnels, the Rhone and Rhine rivers, the 6,670-foot-high Oberal Pass, and views of the Matterhorn.  The 14-hour Chihuahua al Pacifico Railway, or El Chepe, in Mexico links the Pacific coast in Sinaloa with the Chihuahua desert via a rugged route through Copper Canyon, reaching 8,000 feet and traveling 27 bridges and 86 tunnels.<br />

<strong>Rugged Adventures to Out-of-the-Way Places</strong><br><br>




	
  
		
	
  

Olaf Malver, the founder and president of Explorers' Corner, offers excursions for adventurers who want to travel to places that have not been visited by the resort-going tourists.  Explorers' Corner organizes and leads trips to rugged destinations, including Antarctica, Siberia, and the northwestern coast of Scotland.  To keep customers interested, Malver goes on an annual round of "exploratory" trips to test new destinations that may be added to the company's roster, which currently contains 24 itineraries.  Malver interviews clients before taking them on trips to gauge their experience and fitness, and to make sure that they have an open mind about their experience.  "I tell people, 'We don't know what the hell we're doing, but it's going to be okay,'  " he says.  Malver's trips feature an open itinerary that can change based on the weather and the situations.  "You have to involve the clients," Malver says.  "When you come to a place, you spread out the map and tell them what the options are.  You don't say, 'We're going here.' "  The trips may shelter adventurers in country inns and former hunting lodges, but during the day travelers may be working hard kayaking or hiking, giving group members an opportunity to bond during their hard day's labor.<br />
