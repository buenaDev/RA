Crisis Survival Kit: 10 Cash Flow Tips You Need Now 
bMighty.com (09/30/08) Paul, Fredric

The current credit crisis has many small business owners feeling like the world is collapsing around them. However, small and medium businesses actually have some of the best options available to help them through this difficult time, says consultant Rusty Luhring. Luhring says SMBs need to do some detailed planning to understand the magnitude of the problem, and when their cash needs are greatest. Similarly, Luhring says SMBs can increase cash flow by thinking outside the box about invoicing and collections. First, make a list of all payments due for the next three months, give payroll priority, and see what can be negotiated and paid later. Second, call customers to check on overdue and upcoming payments. It may be possible to ask for early payment from customers that you have a good relationship with. Offer to forgive 15 percent of the overdue balance, or the late payment penalty, if customers with overdue payments pay within the week. Make sure to send out invoices early, as sending them out late results in late receipts. Offering discounts for on-time payments can ensure a steady cash flow, but be sure you know exactly how much those discounts cost you. Consider billing twice a month, on the 1st and the 15th, to speed up immediate cash flow. Ask for some payment up front, instead of just billing for time as it is incurred. Ask for a third up front, a third while the job is in progress, and a third upon completion. Fine tune the timing of your payables to take advantage of the maximum allowable time to pay suppliers. This grace period can be used as an interest-free line of credit that provides more time to collect accounts receivable without spending money on short term credit lines. Finally, consider layoffs. In small businesses, every employee plays a vital role, but staying afloat is the priority. Discuss rehiring employees as freelancers, which reduces the cost of health insurance, payroll, and stock options, and increases their freedom.

10 Ways to Cut Your 2008 Tax Bill 
Business Week SmallBiz (10/08) P. 64; Kahn, Virginia Munger

New tax incentives passed by Congress this year can provide relief for small business owners looking to cushion the blow from investment losses and the struggling economy. First, if your business has less than $810,000 in depreciable property, Section 179 of the tax code allows for up to $250,000 in deductibles on new equipment purchases. Business owners can then take bonus depreciation equal to 50 percent of the equipment&apos;s value, all before regular depreciation kicks in, as long as you start using the new equipment before the year ends. Second, businesses can get credit for paying employees who have been called to service in the reserves. The Heroes Earnings Assistance &amp; Relief Tax Act of 2008 allows businesses with fewer than 50 employees to receive a tax credit of 20 percent of the amount paid, up to $20,000, when they pay reservists the difference between their civilian and military pay. Third, buying a hybrid car for a business earns a tax credit based on the vehicle&apos;s fuel efficiency. Fourth, capitalize on the increase in the standard mileage deduction rate, which rose to 58.5 cents per mile and is applicable to the last six months of 2008. Fifth, investment losses in taxable accounts can be used to offset capital gains, up to $3,000 in income. Sixth, invest in a retirement account. This year, funding a defined contribution plan with up to $46,000, or $51,000 if over 50, qualifies. Seventh, become a landlord as commercial real estate is one of the few investments that can provide positive cash flow while reporting a loss for tax purposes. Eighth, opt out of an installment sale. It may make sense to pay the taxes on the gain from selling a capital asset all at once, even if you are taking payments on an installment basis. Ninth, boost expenses such as restocking office supplies. The more expenses you book this year, the more you can write off. Tenth, clean up your books and get ready for next year. Settle all outstanding balances, and be willing to write off dated inventory.

Deciding on Debt-Based or Debt-Free Expansion 
Investor&apos;s Business Daily (09/29/08) P. A8; Stettner, Morey

Having a good idea and launching a business is not enough to guarantee that your business will succeed. The most successful entrepreneurs plan to expand their company and find ways of funding growth. Some entrepreneurs with a negative view of outside capital may try to work their way to success without help, but with the variety of capital sources available, particularly ones that specialize in small-business growth, funding can be found for those who want it. The key to sustaining success after borrowing money is to take responsibility and make sure the money is repaid on time. As proprietor of a business, the business&apos; finances are ultimately your responsibility, even if you have an accountant or banker managing the money. A franchise model can help a business grow, particularly businesses in capital-intensive industries such as restaurants. Franchising removes the demand to raise the capital through internal cash flow, which can take longer to gather. Finagle A Bagel president Laura Trust says that she used traditional back financing when she first bought the business, but since then she has used cash flow to grow from five to 20 locations. ScripNet CEO Dennis Sponer says he has used cash flow from operations to grow his business so far, but he has since established a line of credit and obtained a business loan to further the company&apos;s expansion plans.

How to Buy the Right Business Insurance 
Inc. Guidebook (09/08) Vol. 30, No. 9, P. 1

Insurance is available for nearly every peril a small business faces, but smart owners buy only the policies they really need. Before shopping for insurance, thoroughly research what perils a company in your industry is most likely to experience, and which can threaten your company&apos;s survival. Consultant David Young says small business owners should only buy insurance to cover the out-of-the-park catastrophe that would irrevocably cripple their business. Young suggests contacting your trade association and asking for any risk assessment tools, papers, or expert opinions for your particular industry. Most businesses will need a few of the basic policies. Workers&apos; compensation insurance is required almost everywhere and covers medical expenses, lost income, and rehabilitation for workers injured on the job, as well as death benefits should an employee die on the job. Property insurance protects buildings and their contents, such as equipment, furnishings, and inventory, making it the most popular insurance for small businesses. General liability coverage is less common than property insurance, but arguably more important, because a claim for serious injury can be devastating. Liability covers any injury or damage a business&apos; employees may cause other people, their reputation, or their property. Business vehicle insurance can cover cars and trucks a company owns or leases, rents, or even uses, and is recommended even when an owner or employee uses a personal car for work. Business interruption insurance can help a company rebuild following a disaster by replacing lost income and paying normal expenses. Some special policies include key man insurance, which pays should an invaluable team member be unable to work, errors and omissions insurance, which is professional liability coverage, and directors and officers liability, which comes into play when companies have outside investors.

Eight Steps to Attracting New Business in a Lagging Economy 
Manage Smarter (10/06/08) Black, Joanne

When the economy is struggling, keeping a small business going can be difficult. Instinct says to cut advertising, travel, training, marketing, and discretionary expenses, but such an approach causes the pipeline to close, worsening the situation and making it more difficult to thrive when the market does recover. A few strategies will help your business stay afloat until the economy improves. First, broaden your perspective and redefine and reinvent yourself. Determine how you can create new demand for your products and services, build new alliances, and consider alternative distribution channels. Second, be nimble and innovative. Be ready to make quick decisions and act fast to create new uses for your products, or even create a new business model. Third, take care of your current customers to keep them. Fourth, prioritize wisely. The most important activity for any salesperson is to focus on the &quot;closest catch,&quot; be it following up on a prospect, writing a proposal, or closing a deal. Fifth, become an expert in your field. Companies hire experts because they cannot afford to make a mistake. Position your company as the expert on a specific product or in a market niche. Sixth, stay connected and network whenever possible. Attend a minimum of one event per week. Every person you meet is a potential customer or referral. Talk to people and find out how their business is doing and what you could do to help them. Seventh, instead of cutting prices, increase value. Cutting prices only cuts down profits. Instead, consider how to &quot;get in and get started.&quot; Offering high-value products and services will lead to more referrals and more sales, even in a slow economy. Divide products or services into smaller, more affordable pieces to get initial purchases that will lead to larger purchases. Eighth, commit to building your referral business. Referrals are extra important in a slow economy, because a customer referred to you will result in a sale 70 percent to 90 percent of the time.

Being Big Brother 
Fortune Small Business (10/08) Vol. 18, No. 8, P. 43; Alsever, Jennifer

Many small businesses are abandoning closed-circuit TV systems in favor of online video surveillance. Restaurant owner Ryan Elmore, for example, assumed that his employees continued to work hard after he left work, but after installing cameras and using an online service to monitor his restaurant, he discovered that the restaurant manager on duty left a few minutes after him, servers sat at tables, sent messages, and gave free meals to friends, and cooks took multiple cigarette breaks every hour and cut corners on his signature dish. However, now employees at Elmore&apos;s Pepper Jack&apos;s Neighborhood Grill know that Elmore can log in online, view a receipt, and call up a video of that transaction. Elmore can remotely see whether employees cleaned the restaurant, if they are smiling at customers, if a customer&apos;s order arrives at a table late, or if employees are helping themselves to meals. Online surveillance companies will install cameras and provide monthly services in a variety of price ranges, and some even offer software that can be used to build a library of training videos, such as best practices for store openings and closings. Elmore started using his service accidentally when a pizza chain he bought had the service installed. Elmore installed the service at Pepper Jack&apos;s and immediately started seeing results. Elmore and his wife Janel noticed numerous times when the restaurant was over staffed, allowing them to adjust schedules and cut labor costs by 5 percent, and food costs dropped 3 percent because servers stopped giving free food to friends. For an annual operating cost of $1,920, Elmore was able to cut operating costs by $100,000. Elmore says he felt guilty at first for not trusting employees, but the results eliminated any concerns. &quot;As an operator, I want to know where every dollar is going,&quot; he says.

Green Inc.: 10 Ways to Get Green 
Pink (10/08) Vol. 4, No. 2, P. 66; Pomerance, Rachel

Environmental awareness and energy conservation have recently been pushed to the forefront of many American&apos;s minds, and women-owned small businesses are on the cutting edge of sustainability. Environmental efforts among small businesses can include everything from producing environmentally friendly products for consumers, such as all-natural shampoos or organic cotton, to outfitting offices with energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs. Many small business owners that go green at work find that the biggest payoff comes from passionate customers, committed employees, and their own personal fulfillment. A Women&apos;s Business Enterprise National Council study found that 71 percent of its more than 1,200 members are trying to make their businesses &quot;greener,&quot; primarily through their products or how they run their business from day to day. A great way to start the process of going green is to form a &quot;green team,&quot; or a committee to chart plans and progress in the office. Set a large goal, such as reducing office energy consumption and waste by a certain percentage or incorporating more environmentally products into you product line, to inspire and motivate employees. Buy locally to cut transportation costs and fuel emissions and to support your local economy. Cut energy by using compact fluorescent light bulbs and put set computers to enter &quot;sleep&quot; when not being used, and set printers to print on both sides. Distribute memos and office communications digitally. Incorporate green, high-performance building technology and practices when designing work spaces, and encourage employees to car pool by organizing a car pool signup. Going green can be difficult, particularly during slow economic times, but the satisfaction and customer goodwill and loyalty gained are often worth the sacrifice.

Economy Stalling Your Business? Shift Gears 
New York Times (10/09/08) P. B13; Bowers, Brent

Until recently, Christopher Hazlett, founder and president of software design firm Integrate Consulting, ran a successful business developing software for Fortune 100 companies. However, the recent economic downturn has forced him to look elsewhere to keep his business alive. Hazlett says in early January Integrate had 12 months of work in the pipeline, but in just two weeks all of his active clients backed out of their contracts. He knew he was focusing too much on a specific area, but the big contracts made that easy to do. Acknowledging the downturn, Hazlett made a big gamble to save his company by switching from its strength of developing software for companies to developing a Web product for a market that includes churches and synagogues. Hazlett is now ready to launch a software program called Event Clipboard. He says the new product fills a niche that didn&apos;t exist, which he defines as groups within large corporations, nonprofits, and small- and medium-sized businesses. Hazlett says he has learned several important lessons from this experience. First, be frugal. During Integrate&apos;s heyday, Hazlett thought about renting an office, but decided there was no compelling reason to do so, allowing him to save on rent. Hazlett also cut his salary last year, and puts much of what he earns into personal savings. Switch to a new product or service if the one you are marketing is not selling. Be patient and look for opportunities during tough economic times. Corporate cost cutting hurt Integrate, so Hazlett is now marketing a budget-conscious product to help customers save money.

When Less Means More 
Fortune Small Business (11/08) Vol. 18, No. 9, P. 81; Kimes, Mina

Nearly 70 percent of small business owners would prefer to keep their businesses small, reveals a Discover Financial Services survey. In addition to the fear of losing control, top-line growth can lower profits. &quot;Growth for the sake of growth isn&apos;t good; it&apos;s bottom-line performance that matters,&quot; says consultant Eric Siegel. &quot;In many cases, you can make more money as a smaller firm.&quot; Expanding a company also means hiring more employees, which results in more time managing employees and less time doing hands-on work, higher health insurance costs, and potentially new labor and employment laws, including the Americans With Disabilities Act, which affects companies with 15 or more employees. Although most companies with fewer than 10 workers never break $1 million in sales, there are some exceptions, and it is possible for smaller companies to outperform larger ones. In 2006, the Georgia Institute of Technology studied the methods that forward-thinking small businesses used to establish and maintain a competitive edge. Many of the most profitable small firms in the study favored strategic alliances, long-term contracts, close client relationships, and highly efficient manufacturing systems. Consultant Traci Entel says small business owners are redefining what it means to be an entrepreneur, using partnerships and technology to expand. The economic downturn may even benefit small businesses, because while larger companies usually have to resort to layoffs to cut overhead, small businesses are more nimble and can more easily dial up or down their efforts and resources.

Businesses Use Social Media as Marketing Tools 
Charleston Regional Business Journal (SC) (10/13/08) Frampton, Ashley Fletcher

Small business owner Andrea Serrano discovered that most customers knew about her downtown clothing boutique through recommendations from other customers, which is why she now relies primarily on the power of online social networking to bring new customers to her store. Serrano&apos;s store has a Facebook page that sends new merchandise updates and other information directly to her store&apos;s 750 registered customers. Although Serrano had been using an email distribution list to reach customers, she says the Facebook account provides another way to get her customer&apos;s attention. Serrano&apos;s store is an example of how the Web tools once thought to be dominated by teens and young adults are now part of businesses&apos; marketing strategies. Many businesses are just starting to experiment with the tools, but marketing experts are urging more businesses to get involved in online social networks. The term Web 2.0 is being used to describe a variety of online tools that promote collaboration, engagement, and user-driven content. Along with Facebook, Web 2.0 technology includes blogs, micro-blogs, sites that scan and aggregate blogs, video-sharing services, and virtual worlds where individuals and businesses can meet and interact. These online options can be overwhelming, but the key is to not use all of the tools at once. Determine your target audience and find the best tool for contacting them. Aaron Siegel, owner of Fiery Ron&apos;s Home Team BBQ, also uses a Facebook page to provide members with updates on specials and events. &quot;Frankly, I think people are more attentive to Facebook than to their own email at this point,&quot; Siegel says. &quot;A big email blast, they might just skip over.&quot;

Skishing 
Forbes (10/27/08) Vol. 182, No. 8, P. 202; Burke, Monte

Skishing, a combination of fishing, swimming, and water skiing, was created by Paul Melnyk of Long Island. &quot;It&apos;s actually swim-fishing,&quot; Melnyk says. &quot;But &apos;swishing&apos; just didn&apos;t sound right to me.&quot; Wearing a wetsuit and flippers, Melnyk demonstrates skishing by swimming out into open water. About 100 yards from the shore, intentionally in a riptide and buoyed by his wetsuit, Melnyk casts his line from the crest of a four-foot wave. Melnyk says skishing is a stealthy way to fish that adds an element of danger to what is normally a peaceful and safe sport. A strong riptide can carry skishers father from the shore than they should go, and the possibility drowning is certainly a reality. Melnyk discovered skishing by accident when, fishing from a rock, he was pulled into the ocean by a 40-pound fish. Melnyk says at first he was frightened, but he quickly started enjoying the experience. There also is the possibility of catching a big and powerful fish that gives the skisher more of a ride than intended. And there is the possibility of sharks. &quot;I&apos;ve seen fins and been bumped by them,&quot; Melnyk says. &quot;But they don&apos;t mess with me because I show no fear.&quot; During the demonstration, Melnyk caught a small striped bass, only about eight pounds, that he reeled in and released, but he says he has caught fish up to about 50 pounds. Other unconventional fishing strategies include kayak fishers, who look to catch a ride by catching large fish off the shore of Nantucket, Mass., &quot;noodlers&quot; who dive into rivers and stick their arms into holes they hope are occupied by dog-sized catfish, and fishers who use bows and arrows on the Illinois River to catch Asian carp that jump high out of the water when agitated by the sound of boat engines.

A Silver Lining for Vacationers in the Caribbean 
Wall Street Journal (10/08/08) P. D1; Nassauer, Sarah

Now may be a good time to vacation in the Caribbean, as many hotels are offering discounts and deals to attract tourists. Even before the current economic crisis, the Caribbean&apos;s tourist industry was struggling. Flights to the area dropped as airfare prices have risen, and an active hurricane season further discouraged potential tourists. Meanwhile, hotel construction in the area continues, creating more rooms that need to be filled. Consequently, the traditional off-season discounts are particularly enticing this year. Worldwide, the travel industry may be in for a difficult time during the foreseeable future. Hotels around the world have started to see revenues fall, despite the fact that room rates have risen steadily over the past few years, except in the Caribbean. The Caribbean is the only geographic area in the world to experience declining room rates over the past few months, with the average rate for a room in the Caribbean falling 8.2 percent since August 2007. Online travel agencies also are reporting significant discounts in the Caribbean. In addition to lower rates, hotels are offering perks such as free meals, resort credits, and airfare reimbursement to keep travelers coming before the traditional busy winter holiday season. The lower rates also are an effort to counter rising travel costs as airlines have been raising rates and reducing the number of flights to the Caribbean. This year, about 15 percent fewer flights are expected to fly to the Caribbean in December, compared to the same time last year. Most hotels say the holiday season is looking strong, but note that bookings are still lower than usual.
