    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on funding with RapidAdvance!

First, I wanted to let you know that I’m now available on Facebook. “Like” my page and find the latest news and updates that matter most to small businesses.

Second, do you have a few minutes to leave us a review? We want to share your story along with all the other success stories and positive impacts we’ve had in the business lending industry.

Finally, let’s talk about our referral kickback program. For every funded referral you send, you’ll get a “finder’s fee” of $500 on a VISA card.

All I need from you is:

Name of business owner
Name of business
Business owner’s phone number

It’s a great opportunity to help business owners you know and also help yourself – so who do you know that could benefit from some extra working capital?

Best,
{!User.Name}
