    <textOnly>Dear Valued Partner,

To ensure we provide top-notch customer service to our partners, RapidAdvance has made several improvement to the Partner Portal.  Below are just a few of the upgrades that are available to you:

Reporting: We now have the ability to schedule and deliver reports to you when and where you want them.  There is also a &quot;Reports&quot; tab in the portal where you have access to them anytime.  Work with your Relationship Manager to create the reports you want.

Submit deals directly through Partner Portal:  You can submit your deals through the portal and attach all documentation by using the &quot;Leads&quot; tab.  You will receive an auto email confirming your deal has been received and is in your pipeline.

Ideas:  On the &quot;Ideas&quot; tab, give us your feedback.  You can submit and idea on how to improve our process, the partner portal, or any other topic you want.  We welcome all suggestions!

Solutions: You can now type in a key word and find the answer to commonly asked questions using the &quot;Solutions&quot; tab.  

Cases: Create a case using the &quot;Cases&quot; tab.  These cases go directly to our Customer Service department who will answer your questions or address your concerns immediately.  All cases and their answers are listed under the cases tab for your convenience. (available 10/20/2008)
